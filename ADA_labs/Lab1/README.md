Implemented the following generic classes

1. ‘InsertionSorting’ class: Performs Insertion Sort on the array passed as a parameter
to a Sort method. The array may be of any primitive data type. Hence, a single
generic sort method should support sort function for all these data types.
The class should also have a ‘swaps’ field that tracks the total number of swaps
performed while performing the sort.

2. ‘SelectionSorting’ class: Similar to the above class but implements Selection Sort
instead. This class should also maintain a ‘swaps’ variable performing the same
functionality.
